# Test description #
This test measures the load of the presenter while streaming audio to it's peers. The plot has been tuned for the specific test machine this test was executed on.

Execute the test like described in the root folders README.md. As audio streaming requires a lot more CPU power and network bandwith than without, one machine that spawns peers should be enough.
