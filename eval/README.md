# Test description #
This test measures the maximum number of allowed peers for a presenter. The plot has been tuned for the specific test machine this test was executed on.

Execute the test like described in the root folders README.md. Depending on your aimed results, you might need more than one machine that spawns peers, as opening a lot of tabs in a browser allocates a lot of RAM.
