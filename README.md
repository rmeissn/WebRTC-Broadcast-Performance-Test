In the folders of this branch you can find all measured scenarios and data to repoduce the graphics or to anaylze the data differently. Folders are named according to the available branches und thus scenarios.

All system data that has been measured by `sar` has been removed from this branch due to privacy concerns. All data that has been produced by filtering the results of what `sar` produced are included. All scripts have been revised to skip extracting data from what `sar` produced. Nevertheless, you must provide a dummy file, named e.g. "test.bin" and some random iface name.
